## Introduction  
As part of the DAM M13 project, we want to create a web interface that allows us to manage one or more to-do lists, the main actions to perform with the items in the list will be: mark as done, add a to-do, delete a task (done or pending).


### Company and product naming  
Our fictional company’s name is _EVENSTON_, and the name of our product is _ToListO_, since it’s based on making to-do lists.


### Appearance and design
Our logo has an integrated animation to attract the attention of different users and to make it more pleasing to see.

The color scheme chosen for our website is:

#5d8fde → Background
#81a7e3 → Primary color light
#e4e7ed → Text
#ac75eb → Secondary color dark
#c19aed → Secondary color light


### Webgraphy and inspiration
In this section of the documentation we have listed several of the websites we used as inspiration, to create the graphic elements of our product or to research how to implement different functionalities.
