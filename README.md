## Introduction  
As part of the DAM M13 project, we want to create a web interface that allows us to manage one or more to-do lists, the main actions to perform with the items in the list will be: mark as done, add a to-do, delete a task (done or pending).


### Company and product naming  
Our fictional company’s name is _EVENSTON_, and the name of our product is _ToListO_, since it’s based on making to-do lists.
